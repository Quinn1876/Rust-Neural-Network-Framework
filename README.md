# Rust-Neural-Network-Framework
A framework for creating Neural Networks in Rust. This is a learning/exploration project so I am trying to build this with as few external dependencies as possible.
This project is also an excersize in working with generics and traits in Rust so that, in the future, I can use the framework that I've built here in other projects
as required.

# Perceptron
The Perceptron is a Single Node Neural Network. It currently uses the sigmoid function to generate a probability for a binary classification. The single node Perceptron
was a good learning exercise as it allowed me to get familiar with some of the ideas of learning through gradient decent. The next step I think from here will be to add
a hidden layer which contains two hidden nodes.
